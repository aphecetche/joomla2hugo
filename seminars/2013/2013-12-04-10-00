In light of the recently adopted ECFA long-term strategy for particle physics in Europe, as well as in view of the priorities outlined in the NuPECC long-range plan for nuclear physics in Europe, a view on the emerging options especially for heavy-ion physics at the high-energy frontier and at the high density fromtier will be presented.
