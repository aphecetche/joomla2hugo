Hadrons are highly relativistic bound states of QCD, which contain an infinite sea of quark-antiquark pairs. Nevertheless, data shows that hadrons can be classified similarly to atoms, and are qualitatively described by the non-relativistic quark model. I discuss how these features may arise in QCD if the strong coupling freezes in the infrared, α

(Q=0) ≈ 0.5. Hadrons may then be calculated via a perturbative expansion around "Born" states bound only by a linear potential given by Gauss' law for A
