Heavy flavor hadrons, i.e. those containing charm and beauty quarks, will be abundantly produced at the LHC and are important probes of the Quark – Gluon Plasma (QGP). Of particular interest is the investigation of parton energy loss in the medium. Using heavy flavor jets we will have a pure sample of quark jets with which to study the color – charge effects on energy loss. In addition, studies of beauty production in p+p collision at LHC energies will be utilized to further constrain the current parameters used by NLO and FONLL calculations. The talk will focus on the very high-pt electron particle identification using the EMCal detector. We present the electron reconstruction and measurements which can be achieved with 1 month of Pb-Pb running at √s=5.5 TeV. We then estimate the rate of non-photonic electrons and present systematic and statistical error bars. Finally, we show preliminary results on B-jet tagging techniques in p+p which utilize jet-finding algorithms (FASTJET) in conjunction with displaced secondary vertices containing high-pt electrons.
