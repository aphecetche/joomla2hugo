The modification of jets in heavy-ion collisions is a powerful probe of nuclear matter at high temperature and density. We will review evidence from RHIC demonstrating a strong modification to high pT single particle yields and two particle correlations. We will discuss how the data can be interpreted in terms of models of parton energy loss in a quark-gluon plasma, the so-called jet quenching phenomenon. We will then review recent data on dijet and jet-track correlations from the CMS Experiment and discuss the implications for the interpretation of jet quenching.
