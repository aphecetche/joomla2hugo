Many radioactive isotopes are commonly used in medicine, both in diagnosis and therapy. However, steady development of nuclear medicine demands the application of new medical radioisotopes which production and chemical processing is still under the investigation. During the seminar, I will present two of them, scandium and ruthenium, recently researched by the France-Poland collaboration [1,2].
