Double Chooz is a reactor neutrino experiment running in France. Recently, its collaboration, of which Subatech is a key member institution, released the first results using the two detectors configuration. At this edition of the Colloque café - scientifique I will show the main results of this latest publication [1], that are the measurement of the neutrino mixing angle θ
13
 and the reactor neutrino flux and energy dependence, both using the total neutron capture detection.  [1] First Double Chooz θ
