XENON1T is the third experiment of the XENON collaboration. Project realized for dark matter direct detection, it consists of a dual-phase (liquid-gas) time projection chamber (TPC) filled with xenon. With its total mass of 3.2 tonnes of xenon, XENON1T is the largest TPC ever built for dark matter searches. It proved to be capable to reach the lowest background level ever achieved in liquid xenon detector.

Conceived to detect elastic scattering of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) with the target nuclei (that induce a low energy nuclear recoils, below 100 keV), XENON1T set the world best limit on the spin-independent nucleus-WIMP cross-section, with a minimum at 4.1x10
-47
cm
2
 for a WIMP mass of 30 GeV/c
2 
at 
90% confidence level.

 


Thanks to the ultra-low background environment, the same detector allows to study other rare processes. Among them, the search for neutrinoless double ß decay, meant to probe the majorana nature of neutrinos, is ongoing. This search is possible thanks the natural presence of the 
136
Xe double ß decay isotope. The signal expected is an electronic recoil at higher energy (~2.6 MeV) with respect to dark matter searches.

A dedicated analysis to study this energy region is required and will be introduced in this presentation.
