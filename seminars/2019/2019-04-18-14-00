Astatine (At, Z=85) is a very rare radioelement belonging to the halogen group in the periodic table, below iodine.[1] [2] All astatine isotopes are short-lived, the longest-lived one has a half-life time of 8.1 h. For research purpose, small quantities of astatine can be artificially produced (by a cyclotron). Actually, one may work with astatine only at ultra-trace concentrations (typically between 10
-11
 and 10
-15
 mol/L), which makes spectroscopic tools inapplicable to probe astatine molecular structures. Due to these facts, the basic chemistry of astatine has remained limited. One of the astatine isotopes, At-211, is considered as a promising candidate for targeted alpha-immunotherapy due to its suitable physical properties (half-life time of 7.2 h and 100% alpha emitter). A prerequisite is to label At-211 in a stable manner to a carrier-targeting agent, which requires knowledge on astatine speciation and reactivity. In this context, a project aiming at exploring the chemistry of astatine has started in Nantes in 2002 and my Ph.D. thesis is a part of it.




The halogen elements (I, Br, Cl) are known to be able to form halogen bonds.[3] Recently, the very first halogen bonds involving astatine has been evidenced, that is between the astatine monoiodide (AtI) and nine Lewis bases.[4] The first part of my Ph.D. thesis aims at extending the previous halogen-bond scale. So far, the interactions between AtI and eight other Lewis bases have been investigated by liquid/liquid competition method and a new record (i.e. the strongest halogen bond involving astatine) was found.

Moreover, the speciation of astatine in aqueous solution is of fundamental interest for chemists. It is generally assumed that astatide (At-) is the abundant species in basic media. However, a new anionic species, AtO(OH)
2
-, has been recently proved to predominate in basic and non-reductive conditions.[5] The second part of my thesis is thus to properly characterize the astatine species and clarify their predominant domains in basic aqueous conditions.
