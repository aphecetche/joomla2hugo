Two-neutrino double electron capture (2vECEC) is a rare nuclear process in which two protons are converted into two neutrons by the absorption of two atomic electrons, with the emission of two neutrinos. The half-life of such decays surpasses the age of the Universe by many order of magnitude and a ultra-low background experiment is required to detect them. In this talk, the detection of 2vECEC of Xe-124 with the ultra-low background experiment XENON1T, built for dark matter search, is presented.

The corresponding half-life T =(1.8 ±0.5(stat) ± 0.1 (syst))x10^22 y is longest ever measured directly.
