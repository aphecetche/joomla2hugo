Objectives:Natural radiogenic Radium has been drawn high attention because of its radio-toxicity and chemical similarity to Calcium, an element indispensable in bones and other organs. A reliable, efficient and rapid method is expected to be developed aiming at quantifying the “labile’ part of Radium in natural water. A project has been started since 2015 in collaboration with TrisKem International, aiming at developing a specific Radium resin for environmental applications based on Molecular Recognition Technology
[1]
. The innovative resin (entitled Resin SK below) consists of a metal-selective ligand, either chemically grafted to a silica support or impregnated onto a polymer support, which has shown a potentially high affinity and selectivity to Radium in environmental conditions.

The objectives of this research mainly include 3 aspects, firstly, selecting resins which are not only capable of capturing Radium but also suitable for further geological research; secondly, introducing the potentially applicable resins into the DGT (Diffusive Gradients in Thin films) sensors with optimized methods
[2][3][4]
, then conducting a series of laboratory tests in order for DGT characterization; finally, acquiring the in-situ data for improving the knowledge of Ra geochemistry. Several sites in France will be involved, i.e. the Loire estuary and two former uranium mines.
