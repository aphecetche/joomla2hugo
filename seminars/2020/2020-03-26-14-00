`In the next decade, the European Space Agency will launch highly promising facilities to explore the high-energy sky from a multi-messenger point of view. 
The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (ATHENA) is the future European X-ray observatory whose launch is currently scheduled in 2031. Being ~100 times more sensitive than the current generation of soft X-ray satellites, it aims at answering two key questions in astrophysics: 1) how does ordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today?; and 2) How do black holes grow and shape the Universe? Since ATHENA will certainly operate at the same period as the LISA space interferometers designed to observe low-frequency gravitational waves, synergies between both missions will also be a game-changer for how we study supermassive back holes.
In parallel, THESEUS (Transient High Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor) is a mission concept proposed in response to the ESA call for medium-size mission within the Cosmic Vision science program, with a planned launch date in 2032. If approved, THESEUS will increase the discovery space of the high-energy transient phenomena along all of the cosmic history with a payload composed of a wide and deep X-ray sky monitor between 0.3 keV and 20 MeV, a high-angular resolution soft X-ray telescope and an infrared telescope for immediate transient classification and redshift determination.
