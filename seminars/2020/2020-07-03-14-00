After Stephane’s presentation focused on a more theoretical point of view, I'll present how the quarkonia production is studied in heavy ion collisions with the ALICE experiment. One of these production mechanisms has been highlighted in 2015 by the ALICE collaboration after the observation of an excess in the yield of

_ production in ultra-peripheral collisions and is a good probe of the gluon density inside a nucleus. But this mechanism was never observed in more central collisions that are dominated by the hadronic interactions.   
 If the photo-production is confirmed as the origin of the excess, new results could help extracting the photo nuclear cross section and providing inputs to constrain the gluon distribution inside the nucleus. Furthermore, the _
